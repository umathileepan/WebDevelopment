            Hi, I’m Uma Thileepan – a data-driven developer with strong reporting expertise and a growing passion for full-stack web development.

            By day, I work as a Junior Systems Developer at Croydon College, where I specialize in writing complex SQL queries in SSMS and designing insightful reports using SSRS and Power BI. My work plays a key role in helping internal teams and external stakeholders make data-informed decisions.
            
            But my ambitions don’t stop there.
            
            Outside of work, I’ve dedicated myself to becoming a full-stack software developer. I’ve spent countless hours at home learning and coding — building personal projects, completing development bootcamps, and deepening my knowledge in C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases like MongoDB.
            
            My journey into tech began in 1998, and while I paused to raise a family, I never gave up on my goal of becoming a developer. I bring not just technical skill, but persistence, adaptability, and a lifelong passion for learning. Today, I’m actively preparing for roles that will let me build complete, scalable applications and contribute as a frontend or full-stack developer.
